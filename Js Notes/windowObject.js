//Window object and some methods in Js

let element;
//element = window.alert('How you doing ?')
//window is a global object so on window methods we don't need to
//call it like the above line...
// element = alert('Sup ?');
// element = prompt('Sure you good ?');
// element = confirm('Asking you a last time, are you really okay ?')
console.log(element);

//some other interesting methods...
console.log(window.innerHeight);
console.log(innerWidth);
//play with the scroll on any site to know this...
console.log(scrollX);
console.log(scrollY);
console.log(location.toString());
